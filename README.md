<p>
To start with I needed to configure the roles of the system which are the permissions granted to Agents per Department that they have access to.

<p>
Next I configured the departments which would allow for the categorization of the tickets as all tickets will have issues relating to thier respective departments.

<p>
Folowing the configuration of the departments, I worked on configuring the teams. This would allow me to pull agents from different departments and organize them to handle a specific issue or user via a Help Topic or Ticket Filter.

I then worked on the configuration of the agents which are the ones that handle and reslove tickets that come in.

<p>
After the agents, I needed to configure the users which would allow me to create the tikets in this role play project.

<p>
Finally, I created a SLA plan to give me an idea of the timeframe in which I would need to close tickets. After configuring these sections in osTicket, I would finally be allowed to see how the system would work through multiple ends and get an idea of what it would be like to work with in real life.
